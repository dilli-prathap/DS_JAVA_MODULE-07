# Ex7 Removal of Nodes with a Specific Value from a Linked List
## DATE: 19-02-2026
## AIM:
To write a java  program that removes all nodes from a linked list whose value matches a given integer (val) and returns the new head of the modified linked list.

## Algorithm
1. Start
2. Create a singly linked list
3. Read number of nodes (n)
4. Insert n elements into the linked list
5. Read the value (val) to be removed
6. While head is not null and head data equals val, move head to next node
7. Traverse the linked list using a pointer
8. If next node data equals val, skip that node
9. Continue until end of list
10. Display the modified linked list
11. Stop

## Program:
```
